            <h2><a id="mood">Mood</a></h2>
            <p>
                With Latin verbs, mood is basically what kind of verb it is. Within Latin, we have four different moods.
                The Indicative mood - this is used for definite statements, think of it as the normal verb;
                <br>The Subjuncitve mood - this is used for uncertain statements such as wishes or conditionals (e.g. God <b>save</b> the king);
                <br>The Imperative Mood - this is used for commands (this also tends to be the shortest form of the verb);
                <br>and the Infinitive mood is used as an indeclinable noun (<i>To err</i> is human).
            </p>

            <h2><a id="voice">Voice</a></h2>
            <p>
                In latin we have two kinds of voice (active and passive). The active voice expresses what the subject is or does and the 
                passive voice expresses what is done to the subject. ACTIVE: I killed Caeser. <i>vs.</i> PASSIVE: Caeser was killed by me.

            <h2><a id="tense">Tense</a></h2>
            <p>
                There are six tenses in Latin. They're split into two groups, continued actions and completed actions.
                For Continued actions we have Present (I love, I am loving), Imperfect (I was loving, I loved), and Future (I will love).
                And for Completed actions we have Perfect (I loved, I have loved), Pluperfect (I had loved), and Future Perfect (I will have loved).
            </p>

            <h2><a id="person">Person and Number</a></h2>
            <p>
                At the end of the verb, it often ends with what we call the person ending.
